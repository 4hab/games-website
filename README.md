 2. **Pacman:** is a well-known game about a little yellow creature stands alone in a maze full of ghosts looking for anything to eat. his mission is to collect all gold in the maze so he can open the gate to join his family.  Our hero dies if at any moment he exists in a square which contains a ghost.

> Minesweeper board is generated randomly so you can never expect where the bombs are except if you play with the game rules
> Ghosts in pacman are also moving randomly
